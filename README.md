# Mobile-application-for-generating-random-numbers
Mobile application for generating true random numbers using sensors in smartphone made for final work

This final work describes the creation of a random number generation application. It is intended
for users of Android smart devices. The type of random numbers generated by this application are
“true” random numbers. The “true” randomness is achieved by pressing the number generation
button to capture the instantaneous data of the default sensors and inserting them into the equation.
The result of the equation shall be inserted into a secure SHA-512 algorithm that returns hash with
hexadecadine value. This hexadecaden value is converted back to decimal and returned to the user
as a final random number.
